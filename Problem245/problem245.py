We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4&frasl;11.







The resilience of a number d &gt; 1 is then

&phi;(d)d &minus; 1
