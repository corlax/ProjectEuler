'''
For a positive integer n, let &sigma;(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. &sigma;(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.





A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with &sigma;(n) = 2n.







Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive integer asp(n)=&nbsp;

&sigma;(n)n
