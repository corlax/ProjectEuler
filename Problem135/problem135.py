Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, n, for which the equation, x2 &minus; y2 &minus; z2 = n, has exactly two solutions is n = 27:

342 &minus; 272 &minus; 202 = 122 &minus; 92 &minus; 62 = 27

It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.

How many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?
