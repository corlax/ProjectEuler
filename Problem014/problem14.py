'''
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n &rarr; n/2 (n is even)

n &rarr; 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

13 &rarr; 40 &rarr; 20 &rarr; 10 &rarr; 5 &rarr; 16 &rarr; 8 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1
