Consider the infinite polynomial series AF(x) = xF1 + x2F2 + x3F3 + ..., where Fk is the kth term in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... ; that is, Fk = Fk&minus;1 + Fk&minus;2, F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

For this problem we shall be interested in values of x for which AF(x) is a positive integer.
