'''
We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square &quot;hole&quot; so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.

Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.
