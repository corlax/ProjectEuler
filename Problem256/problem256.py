Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.



Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1&times;2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.



For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions a, b and even size s = a&middot;b.

We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and &mdash; without loss of generality &mdash; we add the condition a &le; b.



There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.

For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4&times;4 room:
