For an n-tuple of integers t = (a1, ..., an), let (x1, ..., xn) be the solutions of the polynomial equation xn + a1xn-1 + a2xn-2 + ... + an-1x + an = 0.





Consider the following two conditions:



x1, ..., xn are all real.

If x1, ..., xn are sorted, &lfloor;xi&rfloor; = i for 1 &le; i &le; n. (&lfloor;&middot;&rfloor;: floor function.)







In the case of n = 4, there are 12 n-tuples of integers which satisfy both conditions.

We define S(t) as the sum of the absolute values of the integers in t.

For n = 4 we can verify that &sum;S(t) = 2087 for all n-tuples t which satisfy both conditions.





Find &sum;S(t) for n = 7.
