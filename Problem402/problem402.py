It can be shown that the polynomial n4 + 4n3 + 2n2 + 5n is a multiple of 6 for every integer n. It can also be shown that 6 is the largest integer satisfying this property.





Define M(a, b, c) as the maximum m such that n4 + an3 + bn2 + cn is a multiple of m for all integers n. For example, M(4, 2, 5) = 6.





Also, define S(N) as the sum of M(a, b, c) for all 0 &lt; a, b, c &le; N.





We can verify that S(10) = 1972 and S(10000) = 2024258331114.





Let Fk be the Fibonacci sequence:

F0 = 0, F1 = 1 and

Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 for k &ge; 2.





Find the last 9 digits of &Sigma; S(Fk) for 2 &le; k &le; 1234567890123.
