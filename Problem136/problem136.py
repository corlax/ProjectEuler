The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2 &minus; y2 &minus; z2 = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:

132 &minus; 102 &minus; 72 = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.

How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
