A small child has a &ldquo;number caterpillar&rdquo; consisting of forty jigsaw pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers 1 to 40 in order.



Every night, the child&#39;s father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order. As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together. The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).



For example:

121

42

293

64

345

54

354
