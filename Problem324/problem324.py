'''
Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3&times;3&times;n tower with blocks of 2&times;1&times;1. You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however, rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.

For example (with q = 100000007) :

f(2) = 229,

f(4) = 117805,

f(10) mod q = 96149360,

f(103) mod q = 24806056,

f(106) mod q = 30808124.



Find f(1010000) mod 100000007.
