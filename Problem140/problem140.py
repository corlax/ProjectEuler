Consider the infinite polynomial series AG(x) = xG1 + x2G2 + x3G3 + ..., where Gk is the kth term of the second order recurrence relation Gk = Gk&minus;1 + Gk&minus;2, G1 = 1 and G2 = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, ... .

For this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which AG(x) is a positive integer.

The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.







xAG(x)





(&radic;5&minus;1)/41





2/52





(&radic;22&minus;2)/63





(&radic;137&minus;5)/144
