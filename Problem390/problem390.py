Consider the triangle with sides &radic;5, &radic;65 and &radic;68.

It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.



S(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides &radic;(1+b2), &radic;(1+c2) and &radic;(b2+c2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not exceeding n.



The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.



S(106)=18018206.



Find S(1010).
