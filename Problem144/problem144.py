'''
In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.

The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation 4x2 + y2 = 100

The section corresponding to &minus;0.01 &le; x &le; +0.01 at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.
