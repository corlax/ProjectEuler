Consider the real number &radic;2+&radic;3.

When we calculate the even powers of &radic;2+&radic;3

we get:

(&radic;2+&radic;3)2 = 9.898979485566356...

(&radic;2+&radic;3)4 = 97.98979485566356...

(&radic;2+&radic;3)6 = 969.998969071069263...

(&radic;2+&radic;3)8 = 9601.99989585502907...

(&radic;2+&radic;3)10 = 95049.999989479221...

(&radic;2+&radic;3)12 = 940897.9999989371855...

(&radic;2+&radic;3)14 = 9313929.99999989263...

(&radic;2+&radic;3)16 = 92198401.99999998915...





It looks like that the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of these powers is non-decreasing.

In fact it can be proven that the fractional part of (&radic;2+&radic;3)2n approaches 1 for large n.





Consider all real numbers of the form &radic;p+&radic;q with p and q positive integers and p&lt;q, such that the fractional part 

of (&radic;p+&radic;q)2n approaches 1 for large n.





Let C(p,q,n) be the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of  (&radic;p+&radic;q)2n.





Let N(p,q) be the minimal value of n such that C(p,q,n) &ge; 2011.





Find &sum;N(p,q) for p+q &le; 2011.
