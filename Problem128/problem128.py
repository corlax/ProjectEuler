A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal tiles, starting at &quot;12 o'clock&quot; and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an anti-clockwise direction.

New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows the first three rings.
