You are given a pizza (perfect circle) that has been cut into m&middot;n equal pieces and you want to have exactly one topping on each slice.



Let f(m,n) denote the number of ways you can have toppings on the pizza with m different toppings (m&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;2), using each topping on exactly n slices (n&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;1). Reflections are considered distinct, rotations are not. 



Thus, for instance, f(2,1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, f(2,2)&thinsp;=&thinsp;f(3,1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;2 and f(3,2)&thinsp;=&thinsp;16. f(3,2) is shown below:
