'''
We shall define a pythagorean polygon  to be a convex polygon with the following properties:



there are at least three vertices,

no three vertices are aligned,

each vertex has integer coordinates,

each edge has integer length.





For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is &le;&thinsp;n.

Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.



You are given that P(4)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, P(30)&thinsp;=&thinsp;3655 and P(60)&thinsp;=&thinsp;891045.

Find P(120).
