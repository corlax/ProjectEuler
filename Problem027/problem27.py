Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

n&sup2; + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41&sup2; + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula &nbsp;n&sup2; &minus; 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, &minus;79 and 1601, is &minus;126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:



n&sup2; + an + b, where |a| &lt; 1000 and |b| &lt; 1000

where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of ne.g. |11| = 11 and |&minus;4| = 4
