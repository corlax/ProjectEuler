Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon &ndash; or shape &ndash; whose vertices 



vk (k&thinsp;=&thinsp;1,2,&hellip;,n) have coordinates:



  

    

    xk&nbsp;&thinsp;&nbsp;= &thinsp;

        cos( 2k-1/n &times;180&deg;&thinsp;)

  

    

    yk&nbsp;&thinsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;

        sin( 2k-1/n &times;180&deg;&thinsp;)

  





Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on the perimeter and in the interior.



The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of 



adding every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed coordinate-wise: 



(u,&thinsp;v) + (x,&thinsp;y) = (u+x,&thinsp;v+y).



For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-sided shape shown in pink below:
